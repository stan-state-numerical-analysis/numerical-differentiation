# Task: Create functions that approximate the second derivative using the central difference method, and visualize the accuracy for various step sizes.

# 1. Define a function called central_difference_second_derivative that takes a function f, a point x,
# and a small value h as input, and outputs the approximate second derivative of f at x using the central difference method.



# 2. Define a function called plot_second_derivative_approximation that takes a function f, its true second derivative function f_dd,
# a point x, and a list of h values. The function should plot the estimated second derivative using the central difference method
# and the true second derivative at x for the given h values. The variable names and plot settings should be identical to those used in class,
# besides the plot label, axhline label, ylabel, and title. Be sure to import the necessary package.



# 3. Define a function called calculate_absolute_error that takes an estimated value and the true value, and returns the absolute error.



# 4. Define a function called plot_absolute_error that takes a function f, its true second derivative function f_dd, a point x,
# and a list of h values. The function should plot the absolute error of the estimated second derivative at x for the given h values.
# The variable names and plot settings should be identical to those used in class, besides the title.
