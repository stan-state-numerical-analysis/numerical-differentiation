# Task: Use the functions defined in task_3 to analyze the first derivative using the central difference method for a given function on an interval.

# 1. Import the task_3 module.



# 2. Define a function called example_function that takes a number x as input and outputs the value of the function
# f(x) = 5x^5-3x^3+2x+1.



# 3. Define a function called true_derivative that takes a number x as input and outputs the value of the true first derivative
# of the example_function given above.



# 4. Use the plot_derivative_approximations function from the task_3 module to visualize how well the central difference method
# approximates the first derivative of the example_function on the interval [-2, 2] with h-values: 2, 1, 0.5, 0.1, 0.01.
