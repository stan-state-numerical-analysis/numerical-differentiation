# Task: Use the functions defined in task_1 to analyze the second derivative using the central difference method for a given function.

# 1. Import the task_1 module.



# 2. Define a function called example_function that takes a number x as input and outputs the value of the function
# f(x) = 5x^5-3x^3+2x+1.



# 3. Define a function called true_second_derivative that takes a number x as input and outputs the value of the true second derivative
# of the example_function given above.



# 4. Define a variable called x0 equal to 4 and a variable called h_values equal to the list of numbers 1, 0.5, 0.25,...,2^(-10).
# Use a list comprehension to define h_values.



# 5. Use the plot_second_derivative_approximation function from the task_1 module to visualize how well the central difference method
# approximates the second derivative of the example_function at the x-value x0 and with the h_values all defined in #4.



# 6. Use the plot_absolute_error function from the task_1 module to visualize the absolute error of the central
# difference method in approximating the second derivative of the example_function at x0 with the h_values all defined in #4.
